I created this blog to document my learning journey in the world of theoretical linguistics. I'm pursuing this endeavour out of pure intellectual curiosity. I've always been fascinated by languages—actually, my fascination with languages started with programming languages. I've worked with quite a few professionally, and explored many more personally just for the fun of it.

Over the years, though, I've become increasingly interested in human languages. I learned to speak several foreign languages beyond my native French. To varying degrees—either through formal study or self-teaching—I learned English, German, Italian, and Japanese, and I had the opportunity to live in different European countries. I've read many books on different facets of linguistics (history of languages, endangered languages, some theoretical works too) but I never committed to delving into the theoretical foundations. And that's what I eventually decided to do recently.

This blog is my work and my work only. I may use AI tools for the sole purpose of correcting my (sometimes) sloppy English but never to write anything on my behalf. After all, one of this blog's goals is to deepen my learning through the act of sharing it.
