Welcome to my personal journey through theoretical linguistics. This blog will document my exploration of language structure, syntax, semantics, and more.

## What you'll find here

Topics I'll explore include:

- Phonetics & phonology
- Morphology
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Language typology

## My background

I'm a complete beginner in theoretical linguistics, but I do have a strong background in computing science as a developer (a long time ago though). Over the years, I've used professionally and personally quite a few programming languages (which is what actually drove me towards human languages and linguistics.  
This blog will serve both as a learning tool for me and a way to share insights with others interested in linguistics.
